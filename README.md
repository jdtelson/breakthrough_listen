# breakthrough_listen

This repository contains my work as a Breakthrough Listen Intern in the Fall of 2019. I worked on modeling stellar absorption features using Python in order to plot orders, rescale the x-axis to wavelength, normalize by Flux, deblaze, and correct for redshift. I also calculated Chi-Squared values for various stars to detect irregularities in optical transmissions.
